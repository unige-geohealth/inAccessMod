\arguments{
\item{mainPath}{character; the parent directory of the country folder}

\item{country}{character; the country folder name}

\item{selectedInputs}{character; vector indicating the inputs to be processed. Raw inputs must be available. Argument
can be set to "All" to consider all the available 'raw' inputs. If NULL, the user is interactively asked to select the available
inputs to be processed.}

\item{mostRecent}{logical; should the most recent input be selected? If FALSE and if there are multiple
available inputs, the user is interactively asked to select the input based on file creation time.}

\item{alwaysProcess}{logical; should always the input be processed? If alwaysProcess = FALSE and if the input has already
been processed, the user is interactively asked whether they want to process it or not.}

\item{defaultMethods}{logical; should be the default methods be used for projecting and resampling, respectively. For the
population raster, these are the 'bilinear' method for projecting and the 'sum' or the 'bilinear' for the resampling, 
depending on if the new resolution is lower or higher. For the landcover raster, the 'near' method is used for both the 
projection and resampling. For the the DEM, the 'bilinear' method is used for both the projection and resampling. If FALSE, 
the user is interactively asked to choose the methods from a list of options.}

\item{changeRes}{logical; does the user want to change the raster resolution of the population raster? If NULL, the resolution 
is printed and it is interactively asked the user if they want to change it. IF FALSE, there is no resampling.}

\item{newRes}{numeric; new resolution in meters. Ignored if the changeRes is FALSE. If NULL and if \code{changeRes} is TRUE,
the user is interactively asked to provide the new resolution.}

\item{popCorrection}{logical; should the raster correction algorithm be run. If it is NULL, the user is interactively asked
whether they want to run it or not.}

\item{gridRes}{numeric; the resolution (meters) of the grid shapefile used for correcting the raster. Ignored if \code{popCorrection} is FALSE.
If NULL and \code{popCorrection} is TRUE, the user is interactively asked to provide the grid resolution.}

\item{testMode}{logical; used for testing. If TRUE labels of processed inputs are not interactively asked.}

\description{
Process any input layer and copy it to its corresponding folder
}
\details{
A 'processed' boundary shapefile is required for processing any other inputs. A 'processed' population raster is required
for processing any other raster. These conditions are taken into account and the processing of these
layers is performed even if they are not selected and if 'processed' layers are not available.
